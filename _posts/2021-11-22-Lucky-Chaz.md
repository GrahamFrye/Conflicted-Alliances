title: Chaz "slicK hoG" Moondash predicted to win race!"
---

In an endurance race like this, speed is important, yes- but so is comfort. And slicK hoG has that in spades.
Not to mention, Marya is coming along for the ride. It'll be just the two of us for seven days.
The Chaz isn't going to be the only one in the pole position.
